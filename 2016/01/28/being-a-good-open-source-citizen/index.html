            <p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the day in the life of an open source citizen: me. On our app, I was given <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/issues/971">an issue</a> that would allow users to refine what kinds of sale artworks they were looking at, and it included this <em>awesome</em> slider control so they could set min/max price ranges.</p>

<p></p>

<p>{% expanded_img /images/2016-01-28-being-a-good-open-source-citizen/design.png %}</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>But iOS doesn&rsquo;t have a slider like that built into UIKit, so I headed to <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods.org</a> to find something that would work for me. Searching for &ldquo;range slider&rdquo; yielded a bunch of results, and I looked through three or four of them.</p>

<p>I picked <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/MARKRangeSlider">this one</a> because it did <em>almost exactly</em> what I needed, provided a reasonable level of customization, and had a history of development leading up to a recent v1.0.</p>

<p>But I said it did &ldquo;almost exactly&rdquo; what I needed, which meant I&rsquo;d have to modify it. At this point, many developers either look for a different library or abandon the idea of using an existing library altogether and invent one themselves. That&rsquo;s a shame, because it&rsquo;s almost always faster and easier to improve an existing library than it is to build your own.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s step through what I did to modify this library for my needs. First, I checked to see if there was an issue for my feature already opened on the repository; maybe someone else had tried this, and I could benefit from their experience! That wasn&rsquo;t the case, so I forked the library to my personal account and cloned my fork locally. Now I can modify the library&rsquo;s code and commit it to my fork.</p>

<p>Next I add the library to my <code>Podfile</code>, but I&rsquo;m clever about it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rb">pod 'MARKRangeSlider', :path =&gt; '../MARKRangeSlider'
</code></pre>

<p>This tells CocoaPods that I&rsquo;m <em>working</em> on the pod, and, it is stored in a local directory (the one where I cloned my fork). This makes it a &ldquo;development pod&rdquo;, so that the files in Xcode are actually the ones I&rsquo;ve cloned locally.</p>

<p>This is a really important, but subtle point. Normally, CocoaPods downloads copies of the files and stores those copies, but in this case, it refers to the existing files. It doesn&rsquo;t copy them at all: any changes I make to the library while working on my app are to the files I cloned. That means they can be easily committed and pushed up to my fork.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I did. I made my changes from within the app until I was satisfied, and <a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/MARKRangeSlider/commit/aefbeb181b62c8c257a7d0ada1e75834489b1909">pushed them to my fork</a>, then pointed the <code>Podfile</code> to my fork of the pod.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rb">pod 'MARKRangeSlider', :git =&gt; 'https://github.com/ashfurrow/MARKRangeSlider.git'
</code></pre>

<p>Nice. At this point, I continued on as a developer, running a <code>pod install</code> to download the forked library with my commits as usual. I finished building the feature and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/1075">PR&rsquo;d it using my fork</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016-01-28-being-a-good-open-source-citizen/done.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I could&rsquo;ve stopped here, but that&rsquo;d be a shame. Someone else might want the same changes I made, and I should submit them back. I <a href="https://github.com/vadymmarkov/MARKRangeSlider/pull/22">opened a PR</a> on the library to contribute my changes back, and I made sure to explain <em>why</em> my changes were necessary. Because our app is open source, I was even able to link to <em>our</em> PR to show the library author how their work was being used.</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up to find my PR had been merged, and after the author pushed an updated version of the library (including my changes), I updated our app&rsquo;s <code>Podfile</code> once more.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rb">pod 'MARKRangeSlider'
</code></pre>

<p>Then ran <code>pod update MARKRangeSlider</code> so it would update <em>just</em> that pod, and point it to the new release. I re-ran the unit tests to make sure I hadn&rsquo;t broken anything, and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/1077">PR&rsquo;d the change</a>.</p>

<p>This sounds like a lot, and having written it all out, I guess it is. But it&rsquo;s a series of small steps, not big ones, and I&rsquo;ve worked like this long enough that it&rsquo;s second-nature to me now.</p>

<hr />

<p>I believe that using existing open source libraries is almost always better than writing your own, and I believe that improvements made to open source ought to be shared. Those beliefs shape my behaviour as a developer, and as a person.</p>

<p>Making your first contribution to a project may seem scary, but we all <a href="https://github.com/B-Sides/ELCSlider/pull/1">start somewhere</a>. It gets easier, and in time, you will become a paragon of open source citizenry.</p>
