            <p>When I was living in Amsterdam, I participated in plenty of <a href="https://appsterdam.rs">Appsterdam</a> events. Things like the weekly Meeten en Drinken. I even helped lead a class in Swift. One of the events I liked the most was called Peer Lab, organized every Saturday morning by <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin">Samuel Goodwin</a>.</p>

<p>The idea of Peer Lab is pretty simple, but also somewhat profound: developers gather in a physical space to work on things. If someone has a question, they ask the group. If you can help, you offer assistance. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone feels fulfilled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Samuel held Peer Lab on Saturday mornings to dissuade recruiters from attending. The café where we met had wifi and good coffee, which is all you really need when you&rsquo;re trying to get something accomplished on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>{% expanded_img /images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/amsterdam.jpg <a href="http://photos.ashfurrow.com/autumn-in-amsterdam">http://photos.ashfurrow.com/autumn-in-amsterdam</a> Amsterdam %}</p>

<p>Before I moved to New York, I talked to Orta about organizing something similar at the Artsy offices. He was very receptive and excited to see it happen. I would be there every Saturday from 10:30-12:30 to host, and Artsy would provide the space, the wifi, and some free coffee and snacks. Pretty minimal costs. Orta offered the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/events/222362372/">CocoaPods NYC meetup group</a> as a place to promote the event. We&rsquo;ve also been mentioning it to people we meet at other tech events in New York.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been about six months, and I feel that the Peer Lab has been a fantastic success. Every week, I get to meet developers – some regulars and some newcomers. We sit around, talk shop, code, and hang out until pizza arrives for lunch.</p>

<p>From my perspective, it&rsquo;s been great. I get to meet other developers in a really chill setting, and it gets me out of the house early on Saturday. It sets an awesome tone for the rest of the weekend.</p>

<p>{% expanded_img /images/2015-08-10-peer-lab/coffee.jpg <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5dlU_MyORN/">https://instagram.com/p/5dlU_MyORN/</a> Nothing like a cup of coffee %}</p>

<p>Everyone seems to have a good time – people meet, chat, work away on their projects or open source or whatever. Attendance includes iOS experts, iOS beginners, and everyone in between. Non-iOS developers are always welcome, but the CocoaPods branding – and the network of people Orta and I know – make it somewhat iOS-centric. We&rsquo;re working on that.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing our best to create an inclusive environment, with an emphasis placed on <a href="http://cocoapods.org/legal">CocoaPods&rsquo; Code of Conduct</a>. Importantly, the event creates a space where developers can meet, work, and socialize outside of the regular alcohol-soaked meetup scene. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with booze at tech meetups, but it&rsquo;s nice to have a space where people can socialize outside that context.</p>

<p>The Peer Lab is a cost-effective way for Artsy to get respect from the NYC developer scene. This is good for <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/">all manner of reasons</a>, and it only costs a pizza every week.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m happy, the people who attend are happy, and Artsy is happy.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<p>Not everyone can make it to Artsy&rsquo;s lower Manhattan office every Saturday morning. Some developers live too far away, or have family/work obligations Saturday morning.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>I want to see more Peer Labs pop up across New York, and across the world. I want you, reader, to consider starting one. It&rsquo;s super easy to do, I promise!</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t even need a company or sponsor to organize something like this. You&rsquo;ll be surprised how easy it is.</p>

<p>I have a few friends living near Toronto that get together weekly at a café to work together. They tweet about it and invite others. It&rsquo;s nothing formal, but it&rsquo;s valuable time for them.</p>

<p>A Peer Lab by any other name is still an awesome idea.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> a company, and you&rsquo;re looking for an easy way to meet talented developers, hosting or sponsoring a Peer Lab is definitely worth considering. There are a <em>tonne</em> of meetups in tech, but most revolve around evening drinks, maybe pizza, maybe a talk. A Peer Lab can help you stand out – even people who don&rsquo;t attend are thinking &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nice job, company.</p>

<p>How to Peer Lab in four simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pick a Time</strong>. When are <em>you</em> free to do this? Do you like working in the evenings? Awesome! Do it then. Are Sunday afternoons your jam? Sweet. Whenever works for you.</li>
<li><strong>Find a Space</strong>. This is easier than it sounds, trust me. As an organizer, you need a space that&rsquo;s convenient <em>for you</em>. I use my workplace because I live nearby. Samuel used a café by his apartment. Anywhere that has wifi. Pick a place that works for your time – for example, if you&rsquo;re meeting in the morning, a place with coffee is a good idea.</li>
<li><strong>Let the World Know</strong>. Tweet it, send it to some friends, whatever works. You could ask your employer to pay for a Meetup account. Send details to popular developers in your city and ask them to help spread the word 🎉</li>
<li><strong>Show Up</strong>. Most of success is just showing up. At the very least, you&rsquo;ve got a nice time to jam every week, and hopefully you&rsquo;ll meet some other people to jam with.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep things as simple as possible so Peer Lab stays something fun that you look forward to, and doesn&rsquo;t become a chore. Like I said, six months in and I still love it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Peer Lab is a fun and rewarding activity. From my perspective, from attendees&rsquo; perspectives, and from Artsy&rsquo;s perspective. It&rsquo;s simply awesome.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a developer or a company, an expert or a beginner, I highly encourage you to start one of your own.</p>
