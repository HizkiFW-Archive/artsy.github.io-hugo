            <p>On Tuesday at our mobile practice standup, I mentioned that I was in-between projects and looking for something to do. Orta suggested migrating Eidolon, the Artsy bidding kiosk app, to Swift 2.</p>

<p>Our CI is <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/466">broken anyway</a>, so now is the perfect opportunity to make changes that would break CI. Additionally, Swift 2 seems to have more-or-less stabilized in the latest betas, so we don&rsquo;t expect many gotchas leading up to the GM. Finally, this is an enterprise-distributed app, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about submitting to the App Store using betas of Xcode.</p>

<p>So Swift 2 it is!</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="http://media1.giphy.com/media/7PzALWNJotBxS/giphy.gif" alt="When your boss tells you that you can use the new Swift version." /></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it would take long, but Orta was less optimistic. I knew that we would need to start with the dependencies, which was tricky since I was updating to the latest beta (only one day old at this point). Our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/commit/b77a9c2add780a52aac2c48b9cd3a5eb257ab003#diff-4a25b996826623c4a3a4910f47f10c30R59">Podfile needed some changes</a>, but a lot of this was work I had done before when initially moving Eidolon to CocoaPods frameworks, then to Swift 1.2.</p>

<p>Dependencies are weird. Different libraries take different approaches to Swift changes, so I had to evaluate each one individually. Usually it was a matter of telling CocoaPods to use the branch that the library was using for Swift 2 support. It took about an hour or two, but I got our dependencies working.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IO1QU8E.gif" alt="When pod update works." /></p>

<p>Two of our dependencies, <a href="https://github.com/Quick/Quick">Quick</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Quick/Nimble">Nimble</a>, were a breeze to update – even though we were using way out-of-date versions. We&rsquo;re really impressed by the well thought-out foundations of their libraries.</p>

<p>The next thing was getting <em>our own</em> code to work. This was a lot more work than I had anticipated, since the automatic migrator in Xcode didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/abykDJa.gif" alt="When the Xcode migrator fails." /></p>

<p>No problem – a lot of the time, Xcode&rsquo;s autosuggest worked fine, like adding labels to function calls. But it doesn&rsquo;t catch everything. It turns out that a few hours of manually changing <code>count(array)</code> to <code>array.count</code> etc was a great way to zone out and enjoy a summer afternoon.</p>

<p>After the low-hanging fruit, it was time to move on to the more&hellip; esoteric problems. For example, Swift was getting confused by the ambiguity of the <code>&lt;~</code> we use for ReactiveCocoa 2.x bindings, vs the <code>&lt;~</code> operator ReactiveCocoa 3.x uses for bindings. Weird.</p>

<p>I tracked down the problem to precedence. ReactiveCocoa&rsquo;s <code>&lt;~</code> has a <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/5b19af9b2777462e37ead2dfea95e1fea74b7d63/ReactiveCocoa/Swift/Property.swift#L193">precedence of 93</a>. After I changed <a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/Swift-RAC-Macros/commit/57b041d8a99a3e2a90583709ed7ed91f8ca271b8">ours to match</a>, everything was fine.</p>

<p><img src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/PrAMyghZaYjm/giphy.gif" alt="When your code compiles but you don't know why." /></p>

<p>I noticed a lot of changes surrounding the way Swift handles strings. Apple themselves <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=30">have discussed changes</a>, which were fine. I tried to use their <code>.isEmpty</code> property where I could, but I often had to test if a string <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> empty. <code>!str.isEmpty</code> doesn&rsquo;t really sit well with me, so we used <code>str.isEmpty == false</code>.</p>

<p>However, the problem was further compounded by the changes to <code>UITextField</code>, whose <code>text</code> property now returns an <em>optional</em> string. So there was a lot of this code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">if (textField.text ?? &quot;&quot;).isEmpty == false { ...
</code></pre>

<p><em>Gross</em>. We&rsquo;ve since moved onto <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/498">something nicer</a>, an experiment with Swift 2&rsquo;s power protocols. The above code can now be written as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">if textField.text.isNotNilNotEmpty
</code></pre>

<p>Very neat.</p>

<p><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8mpwh1gTe1qciljio1_500.gif" alt="It works!" /></p>

<p>While Orta and I reviewed the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/496">pull request</a>, we noted some things we liked, and some things we didn&rsquo;t like. I <em>really</em> like that UIKit now uses Objective-C generic NSArrays so I don&rsquo;t have to cast so much. I really <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like that libraries, mostly the ones that we maintain, don&rsquo;t use that feature of Objective-C yet. That&rsquo;s now <a href="https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/54">on our todo list</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/52VjAeGgj78GY/giphy.gif" alt="When you put it on your todo list." /></p>

<p>I am amazed at how quickly Swift is changing – as a community, we are still seeing new patterns and methodologies emerge. Not all of them will catch on, of course. But what I&rsquo;m really excited about is that Swift&rsquo;s engineers are building tools that let us do <em>so much</em>. They aren&rsquo;t making architectural decisions for us, but letting us experiment and discover for ourselves what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. The future of iOS development has never felt more exciting.</p>
