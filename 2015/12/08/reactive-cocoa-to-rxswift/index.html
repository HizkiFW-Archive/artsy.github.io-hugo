            <p>When we <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/">built Eidolon last year</a>, Swift was still pre-1.0 and we couldn&rsquo;t rely on the wide variety of available Swift libraries we enjoy today. I wanted to build it using functional reactive programming, because that&rsquo;s how I believe <a href="https://realm.io/news/altconf-ash-furrow-functional-reactive-swift/">everyone should write software</a>, but there were no Swift-based FRP libraries at the time. As a compromise, I used ReactiveCocoa&rsquo;s Objective-C API (the Swift API was months away from an alpha).</p>

<p></p>

<p>The choice to use an Objective-C API – one that heavily relies on the runtime – limited us in terms of what Swift features we could use. We had a lot of closures use <code>AnyObject!</code> as parameter types, requiring constant checks for <code>nil</code> and conditional casts to specific types. It was a real nightmare. We had a lot of code that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">signal.map { object in
    if let castObject = object as? WhateverType {
        return castObject.thingWeAreMappingTo()
    } else {
        return SomeSensibleMissingValue
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Swift 2&rsquo;s <code>guard</code> statements helped clean this up, but the fundamental problem was that we were using an FRP library not suited for Swift.</p>

<p>While we had <a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/Swift-RAC-Macros">built replacements</a> for the Objective-C runtime features that weren&rsquo;t available in Swift, we knew that a migration away from RAC&rsquo;s Objective-C API would eventually be necessary.</p>

<p>I used a bit of down-time recently to tackle the problem, starting with some small bits and pieces before dedicating two weeks to finish it. Here we go!</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>

<p>The key benefits of using a Swift-based FRP framework include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the type-checker to catch bugs at compile-time.</li>
<li>Writing fewer lines of code.</li>
<li>Writing more expressive code.</li>
<li>Having fun with the type checker and protocol extensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Apple announced Swift, they stressed how safe of a language it was. Now that we were moving to a Swift-based FRP framework, we would finally benefit from those safety features.</p>

<p>This makes new features easier and faster to build. It gives me more confidence when I make a new deploy that things won&rsquo;t break. And like I mentioned above, it&rsquo;s just a lot more fun to write Swift with Swift-based frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>When we wrote Eidolon, ReactiveCocoa was more-or-less the only iOS FRP library around. That&rsquo;s fine, because ReactiveCocoa is <em>awesome</em>. But today, there are a variety of frameworks and <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/reactivecocoa-vs-rxswift/">they&rsquo;re <em>all</em> awesome</a>. So we have a choice to make.</p>

<p>Sticking with ReactiveCocoa would mean that we could make a gradual transition (there&rsquo;s a bridge between the Objective-C and Swift APIs). This is <em>kind of</em> a benefit, but also kind of a drawback. I don&rsquo;t really trust myself enough to move off of Objective-C&rsquo;s API completely if a bridge is there – it&rsquo;s just too tempting to leave some parts of the app using the old API.</p>

<p>So instead I decided to not consider the existing code. I asked myself: &ldquo;If I were choosing an FRP library today for a <em>brand-new</em> app, which one would I choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer to that question is <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift">RxSwift</a>.</p>

<p>RxSwift is a Swift implementation of the <a href="http://reactivex.io">ReactiveX APIs</a>, which bring a few great benefits. The API is well-defined and unlikely to include breaking changes, there are reference implementations for Rx in other languages, and tutorials/resources for other Rx frameworks apply directly to this library. There is some extra overhead from having to interact with a larger community, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32542846/reactivecocoa-vs-rxswift-pros-and-cons/32581824#32581824">there are technical distinctions</a> that might influence your decision. Ultimately, though, I chose RxSwift because I&rsquo;ve found their community much more pleasant to interact with.</p>

<p>I started the process by <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/commit/8e6e86d733e36d3c0b3db581019d09296d04cd68">removing ReactiveCocoa and adding RxSwift to our Podfile</a>. Of course, that made the <em>entire app break</em>, which was fine.</p>

<p>I was working off a &ldquo;develop&rdquo; branch, so having the app in an uncompilable state for a few weeks would be no problem.</p>

<p>Then the remaining process was simple: find a compiler error, fix it, and find a new one. 27 days later, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/commit/8e6e86d733e36d3c0b3db581019d09296d04cd68">we merged the changes into master</a>.</p>

<p>The process was prioritized in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the app compiling again.</li>
<li>Get the app more-or-less working (no crashes for common use cases).</li>
<li>Get the unit tests compiling again.</li>
<li>Get the unit tests <em>completing</em> without crashing.</li>
<li>Get the unit tests <em>passing</em> (locally and on CI).</li>
<li>Thoroughly test the app to verify it still works properly.</li>
</ol>

<p>We&rsquo;re currently wrapping up the final stage, but I expect to release a new build for production use later this week.</p>

<h3 id="biggest-challenges">Biggest Challenges</h3>

<p>The biggest challenges were keeping an eye on the end result. When you go for so long without being able to see the benefits of your work, it&rsquo;s easy to get discouraged.</p>

<p>This is the first major app I&rsquo;ve written in Swift with FRP, so there were new patterns and practices I had to learn. Checking in with the RxSwift team helped a lot, with a lot of assistance from <a href="https://twitter.com/bontoJR">Junior</a> in particular. Making the changes in the open also <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/569#commitcomment-14632425">let others provide feedback on our progress</a>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges was the structure of the existing code. Our bid-fulfillment process shares <em>a lot</em> of state – much of it in ways that we wouldn&rsquo;t write today. But I didn&rsquo;t want to increase the scope of the transition to RxSwift to <em>also</em> include removing all shared state from the app – scope creep is really dangerous when your project already spans weeks. It was hard to resist this temptation, but I feel it worked out for the best.</p>

<h3 id="things-that-were-easier-than-expected">Things That Were Easier than Expected</h3>

<p>Things generally went easier than I had anticipated. Using a new library for the first time in production, I had a persistent fear that I would get close to completing the transition, but some fundamental misunderstanding of mine would completely undermine all my work. This turned out to be mild impostor syndrome – with a few small exceptions, the app worked correctly as soon as it compiled 🎉</p>

<p>I tried to get rid of <code>dynamic</code> properties in views, controllers, and view models, but left them on models to use KVO with <code>rx_observe</code>. I tried not to use KVO a lot, and instead rely on <code>Variable</code> properties, which wrap a value in a type that can be observed. I&rsquo;m still finding a balance between these two approaches, but this is largely a personal preference.</p>

<p>A common pattern became defining a private <code>Variable</code> and a public <code>Observable</code>, which would constrain the state (a common theme in FRP).</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">private let _password = Variable(&quot;&quot;)
var password: Observable&lt;String&gt; {
    return _password.asObservable()
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>_password</code> is now the read/write property accessible only within the type, while <code>password</code> is a publicly read-only <code>Observable</code>. This pattern takes a bit of typing, so I&rsquo;m still looking for a way to further abstract it. Maybe a Swift preprocessor would help.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>The biggest lesson I learned was not about RxSwift specifically, but more about how to use the type system to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">stay DRY</a>. For example, I was writing this kind of code in our unit tests <em>a lot</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">expect(try! subject.expiryDatesAreValidSignal.asBlocking().first()) == false
</code></pre>

<p>(By &ldquo;a lot&rdquo;, I mean that I had to write this code twice before deciding to find a better way.)</p>

<p>So I wrote an extension to the <code>ObservableType</code> protocol that would abstract this unit-testing code into a reusable function and operator.</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">func equalFirst&lt;T: Equatable&gt;(expectedValue: T?) -&gt; MatcherFunc&lt;Observable&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    return MatcherFunc { actualExpression, failureMessage in

        failureMessage.postfixMessage = &quot;equal &lt;\(expectedValue)&gt;&quot;
        let actualValue = try actualExpression.evaluate()?.toBlocking().first()

        let matches = actualValue == expectedValue
        return matches
    }
}

func ==&lt;T: Equatable&gt;(lhs: Expectation&lt;Observable&lt;T&gt;&gt;, rhs: T?) {
    lhs.to(equalFirst(rhs))
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now my unit tests&rsquo; expectations look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">expect(subject.expiryDatesAreValid) == false
</code></pre>

<p>Nice – way better.</p>

<p>This is just one example – one that <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/issues/570">we will be moving into its own library</a>.</p>

<p>Swift&rsquo;s type system is really, really powerful. <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/blob/cb31168fa29dcc7815fd4a2e30e7c000bd1820ce/Kiosk/UIKit+Rx.swift">Here</a> are some RxSwift-specific extensions we added to UIKit, and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/blob/cb31168fa29dcc7815fd4a2e30e7c000bd1820ce/Kiosk/App/SwiftExtensions.swift#L22-L56">here</a> are some general Swift extensions that we&rsquo;ve found helpful.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a danger in going overboard, of course. A few times, I was tempted to make an extension on string-convertible <code>Variable</code>s to make them themselves string-convertible, for example. That might make <em>writing</em> code easier, but its functionality would not be obvious when <em>reading</em> it later on.</p>

<p>I tried to keep changes like this as obvious and simple as possible, and every addition was peer-reviewed by Orta.</p>

<h3 id="community-impact">Community Impact</h3>

<p>Throughout the course of the transition to RxSwift, <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/pulls?utf8=✓&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Aashfurrow">I made a few contributions to the framework</a>, but the things I wanted to add were outside the immediate scope of the project maintainers&rsquo; vision. Totally understandable. <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/issues/265">With their assistance</a>, Orta and I and others helped to create a <a href="https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity">new organization for community-run, RxSwift-based libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Now RxSwift can stay lean and focused while the community has a dedicated space to improve all of our ideas, together. <a href="https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/NSObject-Rx">One library</a> I wrote during this project is already under the organization&rsquo;s umbrella, with <a href="https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/contributors/issues/4">another on the way</a>.</p>

<p>Helping to create a new organization gave me an opportunity to practice my community-building skills. It was exciting to <a href="https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/contributors">re-apply Moya&rsquo;s contributor guidelines</a> in a new setting, helping to set a positive tone for a growing community. I had a lot of guidance from Orta and Eloy, who of course have <a href="https://cocoapods.org">done this before</a>.</p>

<p>Making positive changes to the developer community – and, on a larger scale, to the world – is something I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-my-career/">decided to pursue as my career</a>. I wouldn&rsquo;t have come to that conclusion if it weren&rsquo;t for the thoughtfulness and generosity of my colleagues and of the RxSwift community.</p>

<hr />

<p>This transition project has been exciting, but at times it has been exhausting, too. While I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/pull/569">glad it&rsquo;s over</a>, the past few weeks have impacted my life in a significant – and positive – way. I&rsquo;ve never been more excited to be doing what I&rsquo;m doing, and to be working in the growing open source Swift community. Thank you, everyone.</p>
