I'm happy to introduce the next in the [Dev Interviews](http://artsy.github.io/series/dev-interviews/) series - [Maxim Cramer](http://www.mennenia.com/). 

Maxim has been at Artsy for 6 month, working on our mobile app Eigen. Our interview covers how being a remote developer, advice for people at a HQ working with remotes, her work with React Native and what the future holds for the Artsy mobile team.
