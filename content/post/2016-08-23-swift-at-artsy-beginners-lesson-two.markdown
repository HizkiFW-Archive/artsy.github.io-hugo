And we're back! With lesson two of the beginners' Swift-at-Artsy course. To recap, Orta and I [led a course at Artsy][course] to teach our colleagues Swift _last_ August, and we're doing it again. I'm leading the stream for people who've never programmed before.

Yesterday was lesson two and I have a [screen recording][youtube] of my walkthrough of [the material][github].
