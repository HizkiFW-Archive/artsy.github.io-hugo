      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you’ve decided &lt;a href=&#34;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/09/public-speaking-part1-is-it-for-me/&#34;&gt;you’d like to give speaking a go&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps you were always interested. By now you’re probably wondering where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various options depending on what you’re looking for. Would you prefer a smaller, intimate audience or would you like to reach far and wide? Is the topic of your choice suited for a quick talk or would you rather discuss it at length? Let’s have a look.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, sharing knowledge is heavily encouraged and so we write our code in the open, document using blog posts, and speak about our experiences. Many have &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/qnoid/status/702955785064677376&#34;&gt;bumped into us&lt;/a&gt; at various places around the world. And so I often get the question: “How did you get started? I’m interested in speaking too”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of sharing experiences with others, I can’t encourage this enough. Unfortunately though, public speaking is still considered &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/30/clowns-are-twice-as-scary-to-democrats-as-they-are-to-republicans/&#34;&gt;man’s biggest fear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to share with you the benefits of public speaking, tips on how to get started, and how to give great presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
