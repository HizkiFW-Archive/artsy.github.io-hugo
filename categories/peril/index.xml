      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once Danger Ruby was stable enough for everyday use in 2015, it became obvious that running Danger on CI was both a
positive and a negative. On the positive side, Danger has access to all artifacts created during testing - and on the negative
side it takes a long time to get feedback. It was obvious that Danger could &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/danger/danger/issues/42&#34;&gt;run on a server&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a big unknown what that could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2017/06/30/danger-one-oh-again/&#34;&gt;I came to the conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that we would need a JavaScript replacement of Danger - and so I applied
constraints to Danger JS that made a server-side version of Danger a possibility. It was a stroke of luck that around the
time Danger JS became usable for day to day usage, that GitHub introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-09-14-Integrations-Early-Access/&#34;&gt;GitHub Apps&lt;/a&gt; - so I started work on Peril. Peril is server-side Danger. The rest of this post talks about how we use it Artsy today, how you can use it yourself and where it&amp;rsquo;s heading.&lt;/p&gt;
