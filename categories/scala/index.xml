      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late June, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artsy.net/auctions/&#34;&gt;Artsy auctions&lt;/a&gt; team launched our Live Auction Integration (LAI) product. It allows people to participate online in live sales held at auction houses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artsy.net/auction-partnerships&#34;&gt;that partner with Artsy&lt;/a&gt;. It was a big project, begun in December, involving both brand new software and extensive integration work with the rest of our systems. This is the first in what will be a series of blog posts discussing the engineering work we did to get a complex product from inception to launch in such a brief time window, with a go-live deadline set in stone weeks in advance. In this, Iâ€™ll dig into what we shipped on a high level, as well as some of the overarching technical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
