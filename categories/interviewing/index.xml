      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was at the beginning of my career, my first developer job application was to a design agency who were doing Mac development too. It was pretty nerve-wracking to apply for my first programming job, and I came into the interview with no idea what to expect. I had just graduated from university and was at the first few steps of my career, I&amp;rsquo;d call this being a junior. It was a time period where I would need mentoring, and supervision in order to grow. A good explanation is in &lt;a href=&#34;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/14914/whats-the-difference-between-entry-level-jr-sr-developers&#34;&gt;this StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m both further on in my career, and involved with so many juniors in NYC, I&amp;rsquo;m meeting with a lot of people who are in the same position I was then and I get a lot of questions asking what they can do to prepare. This post &lt;em&gt;attempts&lt;/em&gt; at being a comprehensive collection of recommendations. It is subjective, of course, and strongly biased towards my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I jump through to the article, there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that should be above the fold. &lt;em&gt;Chill out&lt;/em&gt;. You might not get it right on the first try, I&amp;rsquo;ve applied for jobs and received a &amp;ldquo;no thanks.&amp;rdquo; Yet eventually I became the head of mobile at Artsy. Everyone finds their place in time.&lt;/p&gt;
