      <title>iOS Retrospectives</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Harvard researcher Amy Edmonson made the unexpected discovery that in hospitals, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250959492_Learning_from_Mistakes_Is_Easier_Said_Than_Done_Group_and_Organizational_Influences_on_the_Detection_and_Correction_of_Human_Error&#34;&gt;higher performing teams reported making more mistakes&lt;/a&gt;. This is unexpected because one would assume that &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; performers would make &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; mistakes. In fact, the number of mistakes isn&amp;rsquo;t what distinguishes higher-performing teams, but rather it&amp;rsquo;s their attitude towards discussing – and learning from – their failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past eight months reading more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety&#34;&gt;psychological safety&lt;/a&gt;: the shared belief that team members won&amp;rsquo;t be punished for speaking up with mistakes or questions or ideas. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to operationalize psychological safety on my own team, and part of that includes discussing and learning from our mistakes. At Artsy, we candidly discuss site outages or production bugs on the web, but haven&amp;rsquo;t historically been great at communicating about iOS problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start doing more retrospectives after things go wrong. So this week, I held my first iOS retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Artsy&#39;s Technology Stack, 2017</title>
      <link>https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/2017/04/14/artsy-technology-stack-2017/</link>

      <guid>https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/2017/04/14/artsy-technology-stack-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artsy was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&#34;&gt;launched in 2012 as the &amp;ldquo;Art Genome Project&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and grew exponentially ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014 we had 230,000 works of art from 600 museums and institutions and launched our first business, a subscription service for commercial galleries, bringing over 80,000 works for sale and partnerships with 37 art fairs and a handful of benefit auctions. That year collectors from 82 countries inquired on over $5.5B of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2015 we doubled our &amp;ldquo;for sale&amp;rdquo; inventory and aggregated 4,000 of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading galleries and 60 art fairs. We also launched two new businesses: commercial auctions and online media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in 2016 we, again, doubled our paid gallery network size to become the largest gallery network in the world and grew to become the most-read online art publication as our highly engaging editorial traffic ballooned 320%. We also launched a platform to bid in live auctions and a consignments service with all major auction houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-artsy-business-in-2017&#34;&gt;The Artsy Business in 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artsy in 2017 is a very wide platform and it can be challenging to characterize simply. But when you boil it down to its essence, Artsy offers information and a marketplace. Our written content and fair coverage keep people informed about the art world, and the Art Genome powers our tools for exploration. Through our partnerships with the major player in the art market, galleries and auction houses, we offer our users a unified platform for buying and selling art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally we consider Artsy to have three businesses: &lt;em&gt;Auctions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Listings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auctions&lt;/em&gt;: Auction houses and charities use Artsy as a sales channel for a commission because collectors want to discover and buy art in a single, central platform that excels at surfacing the art they want from a global market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt;: Brands pay Artsy to reach the first art audience at scale by enabling evergreen content online and for offline engagement during art world events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listings&lt;/em&gt;: Galleries, Fairs and Institutions subscribe to Artsy for a fee because we bring a very large audience of art collectors and enthusiasts to their virtual doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artsy team is now 166 employees across three offices in New York, Berlin and London. The Engineering organization is now 28 engineers, including 4 leads, 3 directors and a CTO. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;d like to comprehensively cover what, and how we make the technical and human sides of Artsy businesses work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Retrospective: Swift at Artsy</title>

&lt;img src=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/images/swift-in-rn/swift-in-react-native.svg&#34; style=&#34;width:300px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swift became public in June 2014, by August we had started using it in Artsy. By October, we had &lt;a href=&#34;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/&#34;&gt;Swift in production&lt;/a&gt; channelling hundreds of thousands of dollars in auction bids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is pretty obvious that Swift is the future of native development on Apple platforms. It was a no-brainer to then build an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/emergence&#34;&gt;Apple TV app&lt;/a&gt; in Swift, integrated Swift-support into our key app Eigen and built non-trivial parts of that &lt;a href=&#34;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/&#34;&gt;application in Swift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first started experimenting with React Native in February 2016, and by August 2016, we announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/&#34;&gt;Artsy moved to React Native&lt;/a&gt; effectively meaning new code would be in JavaScript from here onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re regularly asked &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we moved, and it was touched on briefly in our announcement but I&amp;rsquo;d like to dig in to this and try to cover a lot of our decision process. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re into understanding why a small team of iOS developers with decades of native experience switched to JavaScript, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will cover: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#What.are.Artsy.s.apps.&#34;&gt;What are Artsy&amp;rsquo;s apps?&lt;/a&gt;, Swifts &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Swift.s.upsides&#34;&gt;positives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#Native.Downsides&#34;&gt;negatives&lt;/a&gt; for us, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#React.Native&#34;&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/#React.Native..one.year.later&#34;&gt;1-year summary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessing the app&#39;s Source Code from your Simulator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months twice I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to access the source code of our application. The first time I did it I came up with a pretty neat hack, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really work in many places. The second time however, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/orta/status/786470282093625344&#34;&gt;asked the internet&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/saniul/status/786470857635827712&#34;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/0xced/status/786619335116750848&#34;&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: You can use your &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/350/commits/2a39c743bcaaf2e3b848ad60621198f40365fdd2&#34;&gt;project&amp;rsquo;s scheme&lt;/a&gt; to expose derived Xcode environment variables to your source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the blog post is a little bit about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to do that and what I did with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On our implementation of React Native</title>

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived fashionably late to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/&#34;&gt;React Native party&lt;/a&gt; in Artsy. I had been a part of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/&#34;&gt;Auctions Team&lt;/a&gt;, where we worked in Swift with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cocoapods.org/pods/Interstellar&#34;&gt;some light-FRP&lt;/a&gt;. We were not affected by the 4 months of simultaneous work on moving to React Native, at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a quiet revolution. I did not have to install &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, I made zero changes to the code for auctions and the whole app&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure barely changed. Yet we moved to making all new code inside our 3 year old iOS app use React Native. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, first up we weren&amp;rsquo;t planning a re-write, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that kind of luxury and the scope of our app is too big compared to the team working on it. Second, we reused existing dependency infrastructure to support JavaScript based apps. Read on to find out what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React Native at Artsy</title>
      <link>https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/2016/08/15/React-Native-at-Artsy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://hizkifw.github.io/artsy.github.io-hugo/images/react-native/artsy_react_logo.svg&#34; style=&#34;width:300px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/eigen&#34;&gt;the Artsy iOS app&lt;/a&gt; grew larger, we started hitting pain
points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to support other future platforms such as Android without creating more teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want different business teams to work on the app without disrupting each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want our architecture to evolve in order to increase programmer efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took us &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/22&#34;&gt;about a year&lt;/a&gt; to start resolving these issues.
Ideally, we wanted to find a solution to our architectural issues that would also improve the user
experience. Notably we wanted more efficient networking, due to mobile device constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been an easy leap to start using Swift and, as a matter of fact, we do use Swift in parts of
our flagship application and entirely in &lt;a href=&#34;http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/&#34;&gt;2 other apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Swift is a great language, it’s also just that: &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; language. It does not do much in terms of new
paradigms that solved our architectural needs, it does not help in terms of cross-platform - as most of our code is
building views and thus very framework specific, and it did not really offer anything in terms of more efficient network
data fetching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that the web teams integrate React in their projects with really great results. We&amp;rsquo;ve been
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/mobile/issues/22&#34;&gt;paying attention&lt;/a&gt; to React Native since it came out; the solutions provided
by the React ecosystem ticked all of our boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months ago we took the plunge, and last month we formalized that this is the direction we want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dependency Injection (DI) is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html&#34;&gt;$25 word for a 5¢ idea&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s an idea that has become wholly foundation to how I write software. I want to take a look at some of the ways our team have been using DI in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been so fun to watch the Swift developer community experiment with Swift and to experiment with what idiomatic Swift will look like. No one really knows the answer yet, but we&amp;rsquo;re starting to see some design patterns used more than others. We&amp;rsquo;re seeing some language features used in key ways that define idiomatic Swift, and other language features that are being mostly ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, one of my favourite features of Swift has not enjoyed the meteoric rise in popularity I believe it deserves: &lt;code&gt;typealias&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is something you may have heard in passing, usually from the web team. It&amp;rsquo;s a Facebook API technology, that describes itself as a &lt;em&gt;A Data Query Language and Runtime&lt;/em&gt;. GraphQL is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.github.io/graphql/&#34;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;, and there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql#libraries&#34;&gt;multiple implementations&lt;/a&gt; of it. As mobile engineers, we can consider it an API, where the front-end team have as much control as the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post covers our usage of GraphQL, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the last 3 months of using it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/eigen/&#34;&gt;Eigen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a part of going through the design patterns we&amp;rsquo;ve found in the creation of the Artsy iOS apps, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk a bit about some of the patterns that we&amp;rsquo;ve had and migrated away from. This is not 100% comprehensive, as there has been a lot of time, and a lot of people involved. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and give a birds eye view, and zoom in on some things that feel more important overall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a part of going through the design patterns we&amp;rsquo;ve found in the creation of the Artsy iOS apps, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk a bit about &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Applications&lt;/em&gt;. A hybrid application refers to an app that uses native code and web content intertwined. Our flagship iOS app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/eigen&#34;&gt;eigen&lt;/a&gt; is a hybrid app, and it seems to get more and more hybrid-y each release. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk a little bit about the pros and cons of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugomore42&#34;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-a-hybrid-app&#34;&gt;What is a Hybrid App&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is the widest possible definition above, so let&amp;rsquo;s dig in as this can be a contentious. There is a whole spectrum of which an app can be classed as a hybrid app. This ranges from more or less web-tech everywhere to 100% native code like Objective-C / Swift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about a pattern that we&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the last few years on the Artsy Mobile team. This pattern pre-dates me joining Artsy by a few weeks, and was introduced into our codebase by &lt;a href=&#34;http://90wpm.com&#34;&gt;Ben Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, this was the &lt;code&gt;ARRouter&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s first method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-objc&#34;&gt;  + (NSURL *)newOAuthURLWithUsername:(NSString *)username password:(NSString *)password {
      NSDictionary *params = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:
                              username, @&amp;quot;email&amp;quot;,
                              password, @&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;,
                              ARAuthClientID, @&amp;quot;client_id&amp;quot;,
                              ARAuthSecret, @&amp;quot;client_secret&amp;quot;,
                              @&amp;quot;credentials&amp;quot;, @&amp;quot;grant_type&amp;quot;,
                              nil];
      NSString *url_string = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@&amp;quot;%@%@&amp;quot;, AROAuthURL, [params queryString]];
      NSURL *url = [ARRouter newURLWithPath:url_string];
      [url_string release];
      [params release];
      return url;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, that&amp;rsquo;s pre-ARC, pre-Dictionary Literals, memory-managed code. We took this pattern and rolled with it for the next 4 years, this article is about where we&amp;rsquo;ve taken it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within Eigen, &lt;code&gt;ARRouter&lt;/code&gt; is one of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/904e8abfc11ce6ea4b6e81f0e02684b755a280c3/Artsy/Networking/ARRouter.m&#34;&gt;biggest classes&lt;/a&gt;, coming in at almost 1,000 lines of code. Whereas in Energy, it sits at a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/artsy/energy/blob/e51529250ede359c781042f222d5836eb9e8a979/Classes/Util/App/ARRouter.m&#34;&gt;more reasonable&lt;/a&gt; 300 lines. Eidolon does not have an ARRouter, what gives?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Eigenstate of Mind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to starting at Artsy, I followed a few online tutorials on iOS development. But a simple application demonstrating how to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raywenderlich.com/85578/first-core-data-app-using-swift&#34;&gt;build a todo list&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t illustrate the nuances of a production codebase. Tutorials are an important learning tool for beginners, but can&amp;rsquo;t possibly prepare you for everything you would encounter within an application like Artsy&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have a mentor at Artsy to help me get started, and I wrote this post to pass along the lessons I learned. This is meant to be a guide for iOS beginners to get to know an open source production codebase. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the Xcode project organization and where to find things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How we Open Source&#39;d Eigen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was 95 days ago, and I was sitting before of my computer in NYC. I loaded my terminal, opened &lt;a href=&#34;https://taptalk.me&#34;&gt;TapTalk&lt;/a&gt; on my phone, tapped on my collegue &lt;a href=&#34;http://ashfurrow.com&#34;&gt;Ash&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; avatar and held my finger there. I paused, this moment was a long time, it was worth waiting. I switched the camera from my face to the screen with the terminal open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moment was probably the most nervous I had been in years. It showed &lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;. I said &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s happening.&amp;rdquo; I hit return. A new era in the Artsy mobile team had started. A few minutes later, I wrote this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-cards=&#34;hidden&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have open source’d the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/artsy&#34;&gt;@Artsy&lt;/a&gt; iOS app.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/c1SWtHmUgy&#34;&gt;https://t.co/c1SWtHmUgy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;🎉&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ørta (@orta) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/orta/status/558395611754819586&#34;&gt;January 22, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go over the process we went through to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
